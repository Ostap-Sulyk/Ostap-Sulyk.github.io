    <h1>HELLO!</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>My name is Ostap Sulyk.</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        I am extremely passionate and motivated. And I would love to work side
        by side with other people to solve real world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will fit any team, not only because I can articulate my ideas clearly,
        but also because I am a fast learner and a great team player.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently I got really interested in blockchain technology and spend most
        of my free time learning about it to become a blockchain developer one
        day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides programming I also like photography, mixed martial arts and
        chess.

          Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer
          programming challenges. Starting from december first, two challenges
          are being released and it goes like that up to the Christmas. I
          usually learn by doing so decided to solve those puzzles to learn Rust
          programming language.
